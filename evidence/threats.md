# Threats and Limitations

## Scope Limits

- This repository is a demo-sized project and does not represent monorepo-scale complexity.
- Generated outputs can vary across `specfact-cli` versions and local environments.

## Operational Limits

- Backlog sync requires valid GitHub authentication and network access.
- CI intentionally avoids live backlog sync to prevent token and external side effects.

## Interpretation Limits

- Smoke results demonstrate command viability, not production readiness guarantees.
- Evidence logs are examples and should be refreshed on significant CLI version changes.
